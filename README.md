# Bootstrap nav-step

Navigation Step in Bootstrap

The Bootstrap nav-step is an extenstion of bootstrap nav itself, because
in lot of cases we usually need some kind of step by step component to
help navigate user in our application.

If you want to use go to dist/bootstrap-nav-step.css.

The CSS Documentation can be found in [here][http://dasateam.github.io/bootstrap-nav-step/].

This is a work in progress, we welcome feedback too.
